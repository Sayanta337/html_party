        <h3>So, What is a Solar Eclipse?</h3>
        <p>
          <i>A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, blocking all or part of the Sun's light from reaching Earth.</i><b> Just like shown in the picture below.</b>

        <h3>🌓 How Solar Eclipses Occurs?</h3>
        <p>A solar eclipse happens during a <b>new moon phase</b>, when the Moon aligns itself directly between the Earth and the Sun. This alignment casts a shadow on Earth, which can be observed from specific locations.<br>There are two parts to the Moon's shadow :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b><u>Penumbra</u></b> : The area where only a portion of the Sun is obscured, leading to a <b>partial solar eclipse</b>.</li>
          <li><b><u>Umbra</u></b> : The area where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon, resulting in a <b>total solar eclipse.</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🌘 Types of Eclipse</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><u><b>Partial Solar Eclipse</b></u> : Only part of the Sun is obscured by the Moon. People in the <b>penumbral shadow</b> will see a "bite" taken out of the Sun. <i>Visual example</i> ⬇️</p>
            <img src="Images/Partial_eclipse.jpg" alt="Image of Partial Solar Eclipse" width="900">
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><u><b>Annular Solar Eclipse</b></u> : The Moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the Sun. This creates a ring like appearance around the Moon, often called a <b>“ring of fire.”</b> <i>Visual example</i> ⬇️</p>
            <img src="Images/Annual_Eclipse.jpg" alt="Image of Annual eclipse" width="900">
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><u><b>Total Solar Eclipse</b></u>: The Moon <b>completely covers the Sun</b>, but this can only be seen from a narrow region on Earth known as the <b>path of totality</b>. During this event, the sky darkens significantly, and the Sun's <b>corona</b>becomes visible. <i>Visual example</i> ⬇️</p>
            <img src="Images/Total_eclipse.jpg" alt="Image of Total eclipse" width="900">
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><u><b>Hybrid Solar Eclipse</b></u> : A <b>rare combination</b> of both total and annular eclipses, depending on where you are on Earth. In some places, the eclipse appears total; in others, it appears annular. <i>Visual example</i> ⬇️</p>
            <img src="Images/Hybrid_eclipse.jpg" alt="Image of hybrid eclipse" width="900">

        <h3>📆 How Often Do Solar Eclipses Occur?</h3>
        <p>Solar eclipses occur <b>approximately twice a year</b>, but <b>total solar eclipses</b> are far less common for any single location. On average, a total solar eclipse may occur at a specific place <b>once every 360 to 410 years</b>. The <b>path of totality</b> is narrow, so timing and location are critical.</p>

        <h3>🔬 Why Should You Care?</h3>
        <p>Because, Solar eclipses are <b>not just stunning sky shows</b>, they offer scientists valuable chances to <b>study the Sun's corona</b> and other solar phenomena that are usually hidden by the Sun's brightness.</p>

        <h3>📝 In Summary</h3>
        <p>A solar eclipse is a captivating celestial event that highlights the <b>complex relationship between the Earth, Moon, and Sun</b> creating unforgettable experiences for those lucky enough to witness them.</p>
